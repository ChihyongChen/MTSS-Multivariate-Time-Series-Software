# Summary

MTSS is a GPU/CPU software designed for the Classification and the Subsequence Similarity Search of MTSO.
Originally inspired by [1], MTSS aims to improve the Time Performance and Accuracy for classifying and sub-searching any kind of MTS by using the well known similarity measure: Dynamic Time Warping (DTW).
