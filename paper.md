# Summary
In these days, the alignment of multidimensional sequences is required in many fields such as bio-informatics, speech recognition, time-series analysis, etc. The comparison of different time series is involved for discovering similarities and pattern in data. The most important involved tasks are: 1) *indexing* is process to identify the most similar time series in a dataset given a query time series; 2) *classification* is used to categorize data into predefined group; 3) *clustering* is an unsupervised categorization of data; 4) *anomaly detection* is the identification of abnormal or unique data items. For such tasks it is necessary to compare time series using an appropriate similarity measure[ref] which could not be very efficiently handled by using a traditional DTW, since it makes each pairwise alignment independently and cause each dimensions to be compared separately. Although these problems seem to be already solved in the state-of-art, almost all of them doesn't mention the problem to process these tasks on large amount of data in an reasonable amount of time. In this work, we propose a Multivariate Time Series Software (MTSS) software for speeding-up the above mentioned task.

The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is known as a distance measure used for comparing two time signal. In particular,  the  characteristic  of  these  signals  can  vary both in dimension and time (time warping). Letâ€™s think, for example a two equal sentences spoken at  different rate. The DTW is used to align pairs of signals but with the drawback that it can be only used for mono-dimensional signals. In many cases, signals are represented by more than on single attribute at time (e.g., Mel-Frequency Cepstra Coef-ficients (MFCC), gesture signals, etc.). This problem has been solved in [sanguansat2012multiple] with the Multidimensional DynamicTime Warping (MD-DTW), which allow the alignment of multidimensional time signals by simply extending the concept behind the DTW but shows low-speed performance when applied on high dimensional problems which so far, it has not been investigated yet.

In this work we propose a GP-GPU Multivariate Time Serie Software (MTSS) framework for the analysis of Multivariate Time Series Object (MTSO). Since the warping of two K-dimensional time series is a really time consuming task, we developed a GP-GPU software for tackling down this problem. The platform used for this purpose is CUDA toolkit which is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general computing on graphical processing units (GPUs). CUDA has its own device memory on the card and can execute many threads in parallel [@NVIDIA] which in turn allow each k-th DTW distance (on different segments of the time series) to be computed in parallel. Each of these threads is assigned an ID, that's used to determine the memory addresses (i.e., the segment of the time series) on which it should operate on. The hardware is free to determine the mapping and scheduling of these threads on the available processing cores. A thread block is defined as a batch of threads that are guaranteed to run simultaneously and cooperate with each other through shared resources. The size of a thread block can be specified at runtime.

# Software Details
The software is purely written in CUDA, using C language as support and can be used as a Standard Command Line Options style. It's mainly designed for MTSO *Classification* and the *Subsequence Similarity Search*. Originally inspired by [sart2010accelerating], MTSS aims at improving the *Time Performance* for classifying and sub-searching any kind of MTSO by using the DTW measure. 
While testing the software, we verified that MTSS drastically improves the time performance of the two previous cited tasks, achieving almost three order of magnitude of speedup.

Although  the classic DTW approach for measuring the K-dimensional DTW distance of two signals  may  represents  the  best approach, in some cases different approahces have shown better results [shokoohi2015non].  MTSS includes two variants for computing the DTW measure, namely:

1. **D-MDTW:** Dependent-Multivariate Dynamic Time Warping
2. **I-MDTW:** Independent-Multivariate Dynamic Time Warping

These two approaches differ from one to another for the way in which the *k's* DTW are computed. In addition to these two approaches, our software provides a *Multivariate Rotation Dynamic Time Warping* (R-MDTW) approach, for getting better classification results on specific scenarios.
