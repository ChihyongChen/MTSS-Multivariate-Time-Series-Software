<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>In these days the alignment of multidimensional sequences is required in many fields such as bio-informatics, image and audio analysis, business, etc. The comparison of different time series is involved in discovering similarities and patterns in data. The most important involved tasks are: 1) <em>indexing</em> is the process of identifying the most similar time series in a dataset given a query time series; 2) <em>classification</em> is the supervised categorization process of data into predefined groups; 3) <em>clustering</em> is the process of partitioning a set of data into a set of meaningful sub-classes; 4) <em>anomaly detection</em> is the identification process of abnormal or unique data items in a dataset given a reference pattern. For such tasks it is necessary to compare time series using an appropriate similarity measure, which cannot be handled very efficiently by using the traditional Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), since it makes each pairwise alignment independently and cause each dimension to be compared separately. Although these problems seem to be already solved in the state-of-art, nobody mentions the problem to process these tasks on large quantities of data in a reasonable amount of time. In this work, we propose a GP-GPU Multivariate Time Series Software (MTSS) for addressing this problem.</p>
<p>The DTW is known as a distance measure used for comparing two time signals. In particular, the characteristic of these signals can vary both in dimension and time, the latter known in the literature as the <em>time warping problem</em> (e.g., two equal sentences spoken at different rates). The DTW is mainly used to align pairs of monodimensional signals which is an important issue when dealing with signals represented by more than just one single attribute at time (e.g., set of audio/video features, gesture signals components, etc.). This problem has been addressed in [], that allows the alignment of multidimensional time signals by simply extending the concept behind the DTW but showing <em>low-speed performance</em> when applied on high dimensional problems, which so far has not been investigated yet. The reason why such task is so time consuming is due to the alignment process of the several dimensions of two time series.</p>
<p>Our software has been developed with the purpose of tackling down this problem and speeding-up the above mentioned tasks. Its usage is referred/recommended to those people who need to analyze large quantities of multidimensional data in an affordable amount of time or to those who aim to analyze the execution speed of these tasks among GPU and CPU. The platform used for developing the software is CUDA toolkit, which is a parallel computing platform and programming model, developed by NVIDIA for general computing on graphical processing units. CUDA has its own device memory on the card and can execute many threads in parallel [] which in turn allow each k-th DTW distance (on different segments of the time series) to be computed faster. Each of these threads is assigned an id, that's used to determine the memory addresses (i.e., the segment of the time series) on which it should operate on. The hardware is free to determine the mapping and scheduling of these threads on the available processing cores. A thread block (which dimension can be specified at runtime) is defined as a batch of threads that are guaranteed to run simultaneously and cooperate with each other through shared resources.</p>
<h1>Software Details</h1>
<p>The software is purely written in CUDA, using C language as support and can be used as a <em>standard command line options style</em>. It's mainly designed for time series <em>classification</em> and <em>subsequence similarity search</em>. Originally inspired by [], MTSS aims at improving the speed-up [] for the earlier mentioned tasks on any kind of multidimensional signal by using variations of the classic DTW measure. While testing the software, we verified that MTSS drastically improves the time performance of such tasks, achieving almost three order of magnitude speedup.</p>
<p>Although the DTW approach for measuring k-dimensional DTW distances of two signals may represent the best approach, in some cases different approaches have shown better results []. MTSS includes two variants for computing the DTW similarity measure, namely:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><b>D-MDTW:</b> Dependent-Multivariate Dynamic Time Warping</li>
<li><b>I-MDTW:</b> Independent-Multivariate Dynamic Time Warping</li>
</ol>
<p>These two approaches differ from one to another for the way in which the <em>k's</em> DTW are computed. In addition to these two, our software provides a <em>Multivariate Rotation Dynamic Time Warping</em> (R-MDTW) approach, for getting better classification results on certain scenarios.</p>
